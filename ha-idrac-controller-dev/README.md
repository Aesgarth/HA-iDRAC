Home Assistant iDRAC Controller Add-on (Development Version)
<font color="red">⚠️ DEVELOPMENT VERSION - USE WITH CAUTION! ⚠️</font>

This is a work-in-progress, development version of the HA iDRAC Controller add-on. It is intended for testing and feedback. Unexpected behavior or bugs are possible. Use this version at your own risk, as incorrect fan configuration could potentially lead to server overheating if not carefully monitored.

Control multiple Dell PowerEdge servers' fan speeds and monitor key server metrics directly from a single instance in Home Assistant.

This add-on connects to your servers' iDRAC interfaces using IPMI to:

Read key metrics like temperatures (CPU, Inlet, Exhaust), fan speeds (RPM), and power consumption (Watts).

Monitor the status of individual Power Supply Units (PSUs) to detect power loss or hardware failure.

Provide advanced, per-server fan control with multiple modes.

Publish all data to MQTT for seamless integration with Home Assistant, creating sensors automatically via MQTT Discovery.

Provide a comprehensive Web UI (via Ingress) for a live status dashboard and full configuration of all connected servers.

Features
Multi-Server Support: Monitor and control all your Dell PowerEdge servers from a single add-on instance.

Advanced Fan Control: Choose your preferred fan management mode on a per-server basis:

Simple Thresholds: A 3-tier system (Base, High, Critical) for straightforward fan management.

Multi-Point Curve: Define a custom temperature-to-fan-speed curve for smooth and granular control.

Target Temperature: Set a desired CPU temperature, and the add-on will automatically adjust fan speeds to maintain it.

Comprehensive Server Monitoring: Creates a dedicated device in Home Assistant for each server with sensors for:

Individual CPU Temperatures

Hottest CPU Temperature

Inlet & Exhaust Temperatures

Individual Fan Speeds (RPM)

Power Consumption (Watts)

Target Fan Speed Percentage

PSU Status (OK/Problem)

Server Connectivity (Online/Offline)

Remote Actions:

Graceful Shutdown: A "Shutdown Server" button is created for each server in Home Assistant.

Web UI via Ingress:

View a live dashboard of all monitored servers.

A dedicated "Manage Servers" page to add, edit, and delete servers and configure their fan control settings.

MQTT Auto-Discovery: Automatically creates and configures all entities in Home Assistant.

<font color="orange">⚠️ Important Note for Testers ⚠️</font>
This version is for active development. Please report any issues or bugs you encounter.

Closely monitor your server's temperatures after configuring and enabling fan control.

The developer is not responsible for any damage arising from the use of this development software.

Prerequisites
Dell PowerEdge Server with iDRAC: The add-on uses IPMI, which is available on most Dell servers (iDRAC 7, 8, 9+ should work). Tested on an R720 with iDRAC7.

Network Connectivity: Your Home Assistant instance must be able to reach each server's iDRAC IP address.

IPMI over LAN Enabled in iDRAC: This is crucial for the add-on to function.

Log in to your iDRAC's web interface.

Navigate to iDRAC Settings -> Network (or Connectivity).

Find the IPMI Settings section.

Ensure Enable IPMI Over LAN is checked.

Set the Channel Privilege Level Limit to Administrator.

Save the settings.

MQTT Broker: You need an MQTT broker accessible by Home Assistant. The core-mosquitto add-on is recommended.

Installation
Add the Repository to Home Assistant:

In Home Assistant, go to Settings > Add-ons.

Click the ADD-ON STORE button.

Click the three-dots menu (⋮) in the top right and select Repositories.

Paste the following URL and click ADD:

https://github.com/Aesgarth/HA-iDRAC
Install the Add-on:

Refresh the page. You should now see the "HA iDRAC Controller BETA" add-on in the store.

Click on it and then click INSTALL.

Configuration
Configuration is now handled almost entirely through the add-on's Web UI.

Initial Add-on Setup:

Go to the add-on page (Settings > Add-ons > HA iDRAC Controller BETA).

Switch to the Configuration tab.

Fill in your MQTT Broker details.

The fan speed and temperature thresholds on this page act as global defaults for newly added servers.

Click SAVE.

Adding Servers:

Go to the Info tab and START the add-on.

Click OPEN WEB UI.

Click the Manage Servers link.

Use the "Add New Server" form to add your first server. The form will be pre-filled with the global defaults you just set.

After adding or editing servers, a link will appear prompting you to restart the add-on. You must restart the add-on for your changes to take effect.

Web UI (Ingress Panel)
The Web UI is the primary interface for this add-on:

Dashboard: Shows a live status overview for every enabled server. The page auto-refreshes.

Manage Servers Page: Allows you to add, edit, or delete your server configurations. When editing a server, you can select the desired fan control mode and configure its specific parameters.

Entities Created in Home Assistant
For each server, the add-on will create a new device in Home Assistant with the following entities:

Controls:

button.idrac_server_alias_shutdown_server

Sensors:

binary_sensor.idrac_server_alias_status (Online/Offline)

binary_sensor.idrac_server_alias_psu_status for each power supply.

Numerous sensors for temperatures, fan speeds, and power usage.

(Entity IDs will be based on the unique alias you give each server).

Troubleshooting
Check the Add-on Log: The first place to look for errors is the "Log" tab of the add-on. Set the "Log Level" to debug or trace in the Configuration tab for more detail.

IPMI Errors: Verify "IPMI over LAN" is enabled and that all credentials are correct for each server in the Web UI.

MQTT Errors: Check your MQTT credentials in the add-on's Configuration tab.

Incorrect Sensor Data: The regex patterns for parsing sensor data in app/ipmi_manager.py may need to be adjusted for your specific server model if you see incorrect or missing values.

Contributing / Reporting Issues
This is a development version. Please report any bugs, issues, or feature suggestions by opening an issue on the GitHub repository. Please provide logs and details about your server model if you encounter problems.
